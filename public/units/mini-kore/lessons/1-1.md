# Say it like you mean it

Mini has 19 letters (a b d e f g i j k l m n o p r s t u v).
All of the consonants (b d f g j k l m n p r s t v) are pronounced exactly the same as they are in English. Phew!

The vowels are pronounced like they are in Spanish, Italian, German, and many other languages:

    A — ah — father
    E — eh — met
    I — ee — eat
    O — oh - moment
    U — oo — moo

The only other pronunciation rule you need to know is that words are always stressed or emphasized on their second-to-last syllable:

    animale = ah-nee-MAH-leh, not ah-nee-mah-LEH
    veji = VEH-jee, not veh-JEE
